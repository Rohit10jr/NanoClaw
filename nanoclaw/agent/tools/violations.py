"""How blocked tool calls are reported to the model.

Mirrors nanobot/agent/tools/execution.py (``is_ssrf_violation``,
``_classify_violation``, ``_ssrf_soft_payload``) and the workspace-violation
throttle in nanobot/utils/runtime.py (``workspace_violation_signature``,
``repeated_workspace_violation_error``).

- A private-network block gets a fixed "non-bypassable" note instead of the
  usual retry hint, so the model stops trying other ways in.
- A workspace-boundary error keeps the retry hint, but after more than two
  attempts at the same outside target in one run the model gets a firmer
  "stop retrying" message.
